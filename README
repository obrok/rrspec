RRSpec - Recursive RSpec

The goal here is to reimplement rspec (or write an rspec-like thing) with specs written in rrspec, adhering as much as possible to TDD. Not sure if that's possible ATM. I'm going to create a commit every time the specs fail in the expected manner and another one when they pass again.
